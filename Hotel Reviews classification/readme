Built from scratch two Perceptron classifiers (vanilla and averaged) to identify hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive, and either positive or negative.

Used different approached like:
- removing stopwords
- considering bigrams and trigrams
- word token frequency
- TF-IDF
TF-IDF gave the best results
