- remove non-alphabetical characters
- remove extra spaces
- perform contractions on the reviews

Generated Word2Vec features for the dataset using Gensim library and using the pretrained “word2vec-google-news-300” Word2Vec model as well as
training a Word2Vec model on our own dataset.

Analyzed the performance of the following models:
- Perceptron
- SVM
- FNN
- RNN
- GRU
